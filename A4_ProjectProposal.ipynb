Describe the dataset in terms of number of observations, what kind of features it contains, etc. You must use at least one dataset containing at least approximately 1000 observations (if your data are smaller but you feel they are sufficient, email Prof. Voytek). You are welcome (and in fact recommended) to find multiple datasets! If you do so, describe each one, and briefly explain how you will combine them together. "

Currectly, Instacart has this big dataset with more than a million user order history.
